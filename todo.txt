* Multiprocecssing for triplets extraction (differentiate between multiprocessing for each document and for each chunk) and graph summarization
* Find a way to merge very similar entities
* split entity types into 2 gpt calls, second to check.

## traversal
* do random init so few runs are tried and best selected
